# Pandoc Beamer Template

Convert a markdown file to PDF slides based on [Beamer][bm].

See the source markdown in [presentation.md](presentation.md) and the resulting
slides in [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf).

## Usage

The slides can be generated via `make`, which in turn will call
[pandoc][pdc] (see the [Makefile](Makefile) for the specifics).
I am sorry for you if you are on Windows.

To automate the edit-compile-view slide development loop, use `make watch`,
which will automatically generate the slides whenever a file is modified.
This functionality requires [inotofy tools][int].

## Tips

 1. Citations are processed by [pandoc-citeproc][pcp], not bib(la)tex. The citation
    style can be changed in the header of the markdown file (`citation-style`); it requires a
    [CSL specification][csl] file (e.g., the included [vancouver-brackets.csl](vancouver-brackets.csl)).
    CSL files for common bibliography formats can be downloaded from [here][csllist].
 2. It is easier to debug issues by generating the latex file and compiling it yourself. This will help
    you understand if the issue is in pandoc or in latex. To generate it, change the output format to tex,
    i.e. change `-o presentation.pdf` to `-o presentation.tex` in the Makefile.
 3. The latex file is generated by rendering the [template](presentation.template), which is a slightly
    modified version of the one that comes with pandoc. If you have particular latex or beamer needs, modify this template.
